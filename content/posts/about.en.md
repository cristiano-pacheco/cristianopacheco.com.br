I am a Senior Software Engineer specialized in backend development in Go, focused on creating high-impact solutions through clean, efficient and performant code.

I have experience applying modern architectures such as Modular Monolith, Ports and Adapters, Clean Architecture, and DDD in the development of distributed systems on cloud providers like AWS and GCP. My contributions emphasizes best practices, CI/CD, automated testing, and observability.

When I’m not coding in Go, you can find me immersed in a good book or playing an online match of Call of Duty 🎮.
